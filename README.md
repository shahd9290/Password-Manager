# Password Manager

## September 2021 - May 2022

This project took place as part of my A-Level Computer Science Coursework.

This coursework assignment required me to develop an application. I had chosen to develop a Password Manager, as it seemed simple for me as a beginner's application. Through lots of research, lacking an understanding of Object-Oriented Programming at the time, I was able to develop the system solely through Functional Programming.

Looking back on this assignment there are many improvements which can be made to it - notably the use of Object-Oriented techniques to improve efficiency of the code. However, I am happy with what I had been able to produce.
